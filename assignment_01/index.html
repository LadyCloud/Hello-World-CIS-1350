        <p>
            What Me Worry? Please replace the image above and introduce yourself.
            Explore your editor and find out what features it has for
            helping you write HTML. Feel free to use any HTML tags you
            come across.
            In your introduction, answer the following questions:
            <ul>
                <li>My name is Jordan Wilcox.</li>
                <li>I am currently taking CIS classes to get my associates here.
                    After that I am going to transfer to Wright State to get my bachelors.</li>
                <li>I haven't done much in the way of web development,
                    although much to my relief it is comming quite natural to me as I learn.</li>
                <li>What do you hope to get out of this course?</li>
                <li>Which editors did you try and which did you settle on (for now)?</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            When you're done, zip the folder back up, rename it with the
            format lastname_assignment_01.zip,
            and submit it through
            the elearn dropbox. If you have any problems, don't stress. Talk
            to me before class next week and we'll go through it again.
        </p>
