        <p>My name is Jordan Wilcox. I am currently taking CIS classes to get my associates here.
            After that I am going to transfer to Wright State to get my bachelors. I haven't done much in the way of web development,
                although much to my relief it is comming quite natural to me as I learn.
                By Taking this course I would like to further my knowledge of computers and learn the basics of HTML and CSS.
                At least to the point where I can figure out things by myself. As for editors, I am using atom for this.
                I really like the way it is laid out and I just find it very easy to use in general.
                Anyway here are some things about me that you might find interesting.

            <ul>
                <li>I can play several different instruments.</li>
                <li>I have taken 5 years of German and can speak it fairly well.</li>
                <li>I am one of 13 siblings. (Albeit from separated families)</li>
                <li>I have an obsession with popsicles and bubbles.</li>
                <li>I can make sushi. May not be the prettiest, but it's delicious.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            When you're done, zip the folder back up, rename it with the
            format lastname_assignment_01.zip,
            and submit it through
            the elearn dropbox. If you have any problems, don't stress. Talk
            to me before class next week and we'll go through it again.
